# Intelligent-System-for-SQLI-and-XSS-detection

SQL Injection is a threat which has drastically risen over the years.  It has become the most  common  web  site  hacking  tool  and  new  vulnerabilities  and  different  exploitation techniques are being discovered almost daily.  Firewalls provide little or no defense against SQLi since complete defence might lead to poor performance during database access bythe  website. Application  firewalls  that  combat  SQLi  are  hence  necessary  for  ensuring database confidentiality.Similarly XSS or Cross Site Scripting is a manual script injection technique used for attacking otherwise benign and trusted websites.  XSS and SQLi aretwo techniques that allow easy access to unauthorised data.  We have built an add-on for java supported web applications to drop malicious packets after malicious code detection. As an extension we have added a Learning component which uses intelligence to learn to detect attacks unseen.
